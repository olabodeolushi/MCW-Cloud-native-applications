# Cloud-native applications Project

Fabrikam Medical Conferences provides conference web site services, tailored to the medical community. Their business has grown and the management of many instances of the code base and change cycle per tenant has gotten out of control.

The goal of this project is to help them build a proof of concept (POC) that will migrate their code to a more manageable process that involves containerization of tenant code, a better DevOps workflow, and a simple lift-and-shift story for their database backend.


### Project

In this Project, you will build a proof of concept (POC) that will transform an existing on-premises application to a container-based application. This POC will deliver a multi-tenant web app hosting solution leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Docker containers on Linux nodes, and a migration from MongoDB to CosmosDB.

At the end of this project, you will be better able to improve the reliability of and increase the release cadence of your container-based applications through time-tested DevOps practices.
